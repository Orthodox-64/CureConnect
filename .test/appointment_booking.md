# Appointment Booking System â€” Feature Details for CureConnect

## Summary
The Appointment Booking System in CureConnect lets patients search for available doctors, view time slots, book appointments, receive confirmations and reminders, and manage cancellations or rescheduling. It is designed to be lightweight, resilient to poor connectivity, and privacy-preserving to suit rural and low-bandwidth environments.

## Contract (Inputs / Outputs / Errors)
- Inputs:
  - patientId (string)
  - doctorId (string)
  - desiredDateTime (ISO 8601 string)
  - optional reason / notes (string)
  - payment details (optional, when paid consultation)
- Outputs:
  - confirmation object { appointmentId, doctorId, patientId, scheduledAt, status }
  - human-readable confirmation message for UI / SMS
- Error modes:
  - slot unavailable (409 Conflict)
  - invalid input (400 Bad Request)
  - authentication required (401)
  - payment failure (402)
  - transient network failures (retryable)

## Key Capabilities & UX
- Search and filter doctors by specialty, location (or nearest available), language, and available time slots.
- Lightweight booking flow: minimal form fields and reduced media to work well on slow connections.
- Offline-first behavior for the patient-side: allow drafting a booking request offline which syncs when connectivity returns (optimistic UI + conflict resolution).
- SMS & IVR confirmations for users without smartphones.
- Integrated digital prescriptions and follow-up reminders after appointments.

## Technical Approach (high level)
- Server-side:
  - RESTful API endpoints for availability, booking, cancellation, and reschedule.
  - Idempotency keys for safe retries on flaky networks.
  - Optimistic locking or transactional checks to prevent double-booking.
- Client-side:
  - Minimal JSON payloads and compressed responses.
  - Background sync and local queue (IndexedDB or simple localStorage queue) for pending bookings.
  - Use server-sent events or WebSockets for live slot updates if connectivity allows.
- Notifications:
  - SMS and IVR via an external gateway for confirmations and reminders.
  - Push notifications where available.

## Why this feature is especially important for CureConnect
1. Accessibility for remote users: In many rural areas, access to timely medical appointments is limited. An appointment booking system brings scheduling capability to users who otherwise would need to travel long distances or wait for in-person scheduling.

2. Low-bandwidth optimized UX: By making the flow lightweight and offline-capable, patients on 2G/3G networks or with intermittent connectivity can still schedule care reliably. This aligns directly with CureConnect's low-bandwidth mission.

3. Reduces strain on healthcare resources: Centralized scheduling helps clinics manage patient flow, reduces overcrowding, and enables telemedicine appointments which reduce travel and exposure.

4. Inclusive of non-smartphone users: SMS and IVR confirmations mean the system reaches users who may not have the latest devices or data plans.

5. Enables continuity of care: Scheduling plus digital prescriptions and reminders improves adherence to treatment plans and follow-ups, leading to better health outcomes in rural populations.

## Edge cases and considerations
- Timezone handling and DST for appointment times.
- Preventing double-booking when multiple clients attempt the same slot concurrently.
- Handling partial or failed payments gracefully while reserving a slot for a short window.
- Privacy and compliance: ensure appointment data is encrypted at rest and in transit and access is role-based.

## Suggested low-effort enhancements (future)
- Allow patients to join a waitlist and receive automatic offers for canceled slots.
- Provide simple analytics for clinics (no PII): peak hours, no-show rates, and follow-up rates.
- Integrate with local pharmacy delivery flow for automatic medication fulfillment after appointment.
