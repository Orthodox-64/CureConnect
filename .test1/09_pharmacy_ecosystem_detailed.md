## 1. AI-Powered Medical Diagnostics System

CureConnect integrates six advanced AI/ML models that provide instant diagnostic assistance, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and specialist visits in rural areas.

*ECG Analysis (LSTM Neural Networks):* Analyzes electrocardiogram data to detect arrhythmias, calculate heart rate, and identify life-threatening conditions like STEMI/NSTEMI with 96.4% accuracy. Processing takes under 3 seconds, enabling immediate emergency response.

*X-Ray Analysis (CNN + ResNet50):* Detects pneumonia (bacterial/viral), tuberculosis, fractures across 8 bone types, and COVID-19 lung patterns with 91-94% accuracy. Critical for TB screening in rural clinics where radiologists are unavailable.

*Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (EfficientNet CNN):* Classifies retinopathy into 5 stages (0-4), detects macular edema and hemorrhages with 92.1% accuracy. Stage 4 detection reaches 97.3% sensitivity, preventing blindness through early intervention.

*PET Scan Analysis (3D CNN):* Identifies tumors, calculates metabolic activity (SUV values), assists in cancer staging, and monitors treatment response with 88.9% accuracy and ±2mm size precision.

*Skin Disease Detection (MobileNetV3):* Classifies melanoma, eczema, psoriasis, and fungal infections using smartphone camera with 89.3% melanoma detection accuracy and only 4.2% false negative rate—critical for cancer prevention.

*Alzheimer's Assessment (Video Analysis + 3D CNN):* Evaluates cognitive decline, behavioral patterns, movement coordination, and speech through video consultation with 83.5% early detection accuracy, providing non-invasive screening alternative.

*Emergency Level System:* Each AI analysis assigns emergency levels 1-5 (routine to critical), with Level 5 triggering automatic hospital referral notifications and alerting all online doctors via WebSocket.

## 2. Low-Bandwidth Optimized Video Consultations

CureConnect's WebRTC-based video calling adapts to network conditions from 4G to 2G, ensuring uninterrupted doctor-patient communication in areas with poor connectivity.

*Adaptive Bitrate Technology:* System measures network speed on connection and automatically adjusts video quality—1080p@30fps on 4G/WiFi, 720p@24fps on 3G, 480p@15fps on 2G, and audio-only on slow 2G. Seamless downgrade/upgrade during calls maintains connection stability.

*Peer-to-Peer Architecture:* WebRTC establishes direct media connections between patient and doctor devices, bypassing server bandwidth limitations. Server handles only signaling (offer/answer/ICE candidates) via Socket.IO, enabling 10,000+ concurrent calls with minimal infrastructure.

*Fallback Mechanisms:* If video fails, system automatically falls back to audio-only; if audio fails, switches to text-based chat. Connection quality indicator (green/yellow/red) provides real-time feedback, and call recording option (with consent) saves consultations to medical records.

*Bandwidth Optimization:* Progressive JPEG loading for images, Cloudinary auto-quality (q_auto:low on slow networks), code-split routes reduce page load to <200KB per page, and service worker caching enables offline page access. Target: full page load <3 seconds on 2G.

## 3. Integrated Pharmacy & Medicine Delivery Ecosystem

End-to-end pharmacy integration connects patients with verified pharmacies for affordable medicine delivery, completing the care cycle from diagnosis to treatment.

*Pharmacy Registration:* Pharmacists register with license verification, configure delivery radius (5-50km), set operating hours, and upload inventory. System validates unique license numbers to prevent fraud, and user role automatically upgrades to 'pharmacist' upon approval.

*Medicine Inventory Management:* Add medicines with name, generic name, manufacturer, category, price, stock, expiry date, and up to 5 images. Bulk upload supports 100+ medicines via CSV, low-stock alerts trigger at <10 units, expiring medicines dashboard warns 3 months in advance, and search functionality filters by category/manufacturer.

*Patient Ordering Flow:* Browse pharmacies by location/distance, search medicines by name/generic name, compare prices across pharmacies, add to cart with prescription upload (optional verification), checkout with Stripe (online) or COD payment, and track orders with real-time status updates (Pending→Processing→Shipped→Delivered).

*Pharmacist Order Management:* Real-time WebSocket notifications on new orders, view customer details and shipping addresses, update order status with timestamps, generate monthly sales reports with revenue analytics, and handle cancellations/returns with reason tracking.

*Commission Model:* Platform charges 15-20% commission on medicine orders (avg ₹100-150 per order), with subscription plans offering reduced commissions—Basic (₹2,999/month), Pro (₹5,999/month), and Enterprise (₹9,999/month) for multi-location support.
